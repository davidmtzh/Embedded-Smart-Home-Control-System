## Overview

The **Embedded Smart Home Control System** is a modular, microcontroller-based home automation prototype designed and implemented using **PIC16F876A microcontrollers** programmed entirely in **assembly language**.

The system integrates real-world sensors, custom PCB designs, relay modules, and AC/DC power control to demonstrate **practical embedded systems engineering**.

The project is divided into **three independent control boards**, each responsible for a specific subsystem:

- Occupancy-aware lighting and daylight detection  
- Temperature-based fan and AC heater control  
- Automatic water dispensing with timed logic  

This project emphasizes **low-level firmware design**, **hardware interfacing**, and **real-world control logic**, rather than high-level frameworks.

## System Architecture

The system is composed of **three standalone embedded boards**, each powered by a regulated **5V adapter** and built on **single-layer custom PCBs**.
